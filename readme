Hello.  This document details the various pieces of the Pythia simulation
for the neutral-triggered jet analysis.

  GammaJetExecute.cc   -- This file runs the analysis code defined by
      'GammaJetAnalysis.h'(this file contains the event loop); things
      like the pTtrig cut, output filename, etc. are set in this file.

  GammaJetExecute.cmnd -- This file contains all the settings for the
      simulation like the number of events, pThatMin, etc.

  GammaJetAnalysis.h   -- This is the analysis performed on each event.
      This is the main piece of code where the various trees are filled.

  GammaJetSystem.h     -- This file contains a bunch of miscellaneous
      variables and methods which aid in the analysis.

  GammaJetHistory.h    -- This file contains the definition of the
      'history' class.  It provides a brief overview of the event,
      as well as a complete list of particles which participated in
      the event and some of their properties.

  GammaJet[Etcetera].h -- The remaining files contain the definitions
      of the Event, Trigger, Track, Vertex, and Parton classes used in
      'GammaJetAnalysis.h'.  These are just containers and functions to
      make the analysis code easier to follow / modify.

If the code's been modified, you can compile it with 'make GammaJetExecute'
and the run it with './GammaJetExecute.exe GammaJetExecute.cmnd > [output
file]'.  If anything is modified in 'GammaJetExecute.cmnd', the code
doesn't need to be re-compiled.
